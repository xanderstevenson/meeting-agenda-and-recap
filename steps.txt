* Custom formatting

Regualar Webex markdown is enabled within the agenda message (see [Webex App | Markdown formats](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n7i55j5/Webex-App-%7C-Markdown-formats) for examples), but the following have been specially formatted

! represents the accent header (blue)
$ represents the warning header (orange)
% represents the attention header (reddish)
* represents the attention bullet point (reddish)




* Notes

- Once an agenda is sent, it cannot be edited as described [here](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/messages/edit-a-message) because it uses and adaptive card, which is treated an an attachment, this preventing editing.
If you don't like an agenda, you should delete it from the space manually and send a new message.

- The message is sensitive to spaces, so if you place a lot of lines between points, it will render a lot of space in the message.
